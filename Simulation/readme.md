# Finite Element Method

## Julian Roth's Finite Element Method is also better at explaining the rigorous math, but it's too theoretical than I want.

Solve the original problem (~ partial differential equations) by
1. Turning it to weak form
2. Discritization
3. Making it linear algebra


Strong form to weak form
E.g., 
* strong form: differential equation $D(x, t) = 0$.
* weak form: $\int_\Omega D(x, t) \phi(x) dx = 0$ for any $\phi(x)$.

Strain: $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$

Stress: $\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon$



## Efficient Engineer's Understanding the Finite Element Method has done a much better job
