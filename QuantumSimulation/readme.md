## A modeling hierarchy

* Level 1: Relativistic quantum dynamics
  * System: atomic nuclei (mass, charge, spin), electrons (mass, charge, spin), photons (frequency)
  * Rules: relativistic time-dependent quantum mechanics; Dirac's equation; (quantum) electrodynamics
* Approximation: Particle velocities small compared to velocity of light
* Level 2: Quantum dynamics
  * System: atomic nuclei, electrons, photons
  * Rules: non-relativistic time-dependent Schroedinger equation; time-independent Schrodinger equation; Maxwell equation
