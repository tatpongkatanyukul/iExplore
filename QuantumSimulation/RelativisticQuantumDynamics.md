# Relativistic Quantum Dynamics

---

* [Level 1: Relativistic quantum dynamics](https://github.com/tatpongkatanyukul/iExplore/blob/main/QuantumSimulation/RelativisticQuantumDynamics.md)
  * System: atomic nuclei (mass, charge, spin), electrons (mass, charge, spin), photons (frequency)
  * Rules: relativistic time-dependent quantum mechanics; Dirac's equation; (quantum) electrodynamics
  * Approximation: Particle velocities small compared to velocity of light
    * No go: electrons close to heavy nuclei; hot plasmas

* Particles (such as electrons in beams) show diffraction behavior as if they are waves.  [[Me: double-slit experiment?]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment)
