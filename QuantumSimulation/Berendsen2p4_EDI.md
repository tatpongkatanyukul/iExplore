# Electrodynamic interactions

From the relation $E = p^2/2m$ and the correspondence relations between energy or momentum and time or space derivatives we derived the non-relativistic Schro\"dinger equation for a non-interacting particle ($\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \frac{i \bar{h}}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} $).
How is this equation modified if the particle moves in an external potential?

In general, what we need is the operator form of the _Hamiltonian_ $H$, which for most cases is equivalent to the total kinetic plus potential energy.
When the potential energy in an external field is a function $V(\mathbf{r})$ of the coordinates only, such as produced by a stationary electric potential, it is simply added to the kinetic energy:

$$i \bar{h} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = - \frac{\bar{h}^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V(\mathbf{r}) \Psi$$
