# To do

* Simulation
> Simulation has become a "third way" of doing science, not instead of, but in addition to theory and experimentation.
> There is a dander, however, that applied scientists will use "standard" simulation methods, or even worse use "black-box" software, without realizing on what assumption the methods rest and what approximations are implied."
> This book is meant to provide the ncessary scientific background and to promote awareness for the limitations and inaccuracies of simulating the "real world".

## Optimization example
  * Berendsen (2007), pp. 6: Morse function, approximate potential function $V(r) = D (1 - e^{-a (r - b)})^2$.
